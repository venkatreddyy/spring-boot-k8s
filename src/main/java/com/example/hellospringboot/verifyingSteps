1.Check the Output
If the command runs successfully, Kubernetes will typically provide feedback such as:
    deployment.apps/<deployment-name> configured
Review the output to confirm that the resources were applied correctly.
2. Check the Deployment Status
    Use the kubectl get deployments command to ensure the deployment exists and is active:
    kubectl get deployments
    This should display the deployment name, replicas, available pods, and status.
3. Describe the Deployment
Use the kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name> command to inspect details about the deployment:
    kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
    Look for:
    Events: Check for errors or issues (e.g., ImagePullBackOff or CrashLoopBackOff).
    Desired vs Current replicas.
4. Check Pod Status
    List the pods associated with the deployment to ensure they are running:
    kubectl get pods
    This displays the status of the pods (Running, Pending, CrashLoopBackOff, etc.).
    If needed, you can filter pods by label:
    kubectl get pods -l app=<app-label>
5. Inspect Pods for Issues
    If pods are not running, inspect the logs or events:
    Describe the Pod:
    kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    View Logs:
    kubectl logs <pod-name>
    Look for errors such as container image pull issues or misconfigurations.
6. Verify Services (Optional)
    If the deployment is exposing services, ensure the service is correctly created and reachable:
    kubectl get services
    For detailed service configuration:
    kubectl describe service <service-name>
7. Check Resource Status
    For overall health, ensure all resources are in the desired state:
    kubectl get all
8. Check Events
    Use the events log to find any unexpected issues:
    kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
9. Debugging Common Issues
    If issues arise:
    Check if the YAML syntax is valid.
    Validate the deployment by running a dry-run:
    kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml --dry-run=client
    Use kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name> to fix any issues directly.
    These steps will help ensure the deployment is successfully applied and troubleshoot any issues that might occur. Let me know if you need further assistance!
